Methane Emission Detection using Infrared Imaging
This project for the Methane Emission 2023 Datathon involves a deep learning model to detect and estimate methane emissions from point sources using infrared imaging data from Gao and AVIRIS-NG.

Methodologies used include:

Domain Understanding - understanding the methane situation and terminologies
Exploratory data analysis - analyzing patterns, columns, and relationships in the dataset such as plume and source rates, sigma, ipcc_sector, persistence, and source_type.
Data Preparation - image processing and target mask creation for plume images
Modeling - creating a model pipeline for efficient satellite methane detection and quantification
Evaluation - checking parameters and features, and iterating on the model pipeline as necessary.
